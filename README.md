# Reacting-To-The-Past

**Goal**: Estimating social network of role play game Reacting To The Past. 

**Intro**:
This game's background setting was Henry VIII time period. In order to have a better understanding of English history, students are assigned roles in the Parliament and interact with each other based on the role description. This Reacting game involved many votes on national policies as well as foreign policies. We are interested in learning about the potential social group exist in this network, and see how the group membership changes overtime. 
We will focus on the application of block model. 

**For the ethical concern part**
 The data for this study is collected by Smith College FYS Reacting To The Past (2018 fall semester) and has received the consent from students. 
 The Smith College IRB board has reviewed this study and decided that, since data are non-personal information and are non-identifyable, it does not qualify for human-subject research, and thus do not need the approval from IRB board.
